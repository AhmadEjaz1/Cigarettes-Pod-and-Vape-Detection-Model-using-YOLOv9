# Human-Emotion-Detection-Model-using-YOLOv9
The Cigarette, Pod, and Vape Detection uses machine learning, and computer vision to ensure efficient and accurate detection of 
smoking-related products in dynamic environments such as schools, public spaces, and restricted areas. This system integrates highresolution camera-based detection, enabling real-time identification of cigarettes, pods, and vapes through advanced image recognition algorithms. Achieved a detection accuracy of 94%, ensuring efficient and reliable identification of prohibited items in dynamic environments.
